               <p>
                 We've detected that you are signed up for the Beep App with <b>${users.length}</b> accounts.
                 This likely happened because you signed up many times with the email address <b>${email}</b> using different letter casing.
               </p>
               <p>
                 It was never our intention for users to be able to create many accounts using the same email with different
                 variations of letter casing. We want users to have only <b>one</b> account on our platform.
               </p>
               <p>
                 Because you have <b>${users.length}</b> accounts, <b>we will delete all but one of your accounts on April 30th 2024.</b>
                 We will retain the account with the most number of total beeps.
               </p>
               <p>
                 If you want explict control of which account is kept,
                 we recommend you login to the accounts you don't use and delete them yourself or delete them at https://ridebeep.app/account/delete
               </p>
               <p>
                 This will ensure you only have one account and your account won't be at risk of deletion.
